#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### A digital pet app where the user will race a randomo pet and level it  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can update the title and description. Once that file is added, I will also create the logo image file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A stylized digital pet, a small creature with bright colors and a sleek, futuristic design, racing on a curved track with a glowing finish line. The pet has a small level indicator above its head, showing a progress bar that fills as it gains experience. The background is a vibrant gradient of blues and purples, with subtle pixelated stars to emphasize a digital, game-like atmosphere. The overall composition conveys excitement, competition, and growth.

#### Create an app tittle Digital pet, where the user will spin the wheel to get random pet, started at level one, the player will raise the pet until it will level up , and when the pet is level 20,40,60,80,100 it will unlock another pet, I want atleast 6 pets choice, Feeding, Playing, cleaning, sleeping the pet will get exp to level up, and also get a coins to buy stuff for the pet.  

The changes you’re asking for will require updates to the following files in your repository:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to set the new app title, description, and URL.
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – to generate a new logo that matches the updated app theme.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them.
